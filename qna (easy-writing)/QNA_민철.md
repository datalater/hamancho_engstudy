### 20170213 What kind of sounds scares you?

#### Answer#1

1. **For me**, it's not the type of sound but it's when it's sudden.
2. **You know**, when I'm walking, in the pedestrian foot path, and the taxi, they honk.
3. For a brief second to make, in case you were looking for taxi.
4. **That always makes me jump**.
5. When they don't have any passenger, and they are passing by a passenger, they honk for **a very brief second**.
6. (To see if the passenger want to get on the cab?)
7. Yeah! To get their attention.
8. That always makes me jump and also **at the theater**, when I'm seeing a film.
9. And I **can anticipate that there's going to be a sudden bang or noise, I block my ears** in preparation.
10. **They don't even have to be loud, just sudden**.

1. **For me**, it's my mother's suddenly saying "큰일났네" when I didn't expect at all.
2. And **you know** it's like "어머나 큰일났네" when she realized something wrong.
3. **That always makes me jump**.
4. It's a very brief second, but it makes me think of tens of thousands of any possible things to go wrong.
5. And it makes my heart beating for a very short minute.
6. **They don't even have to be loud, just sudden**.
7. But you know, **at the theater**, when you're watching horror movies, sometimes **you can anticipate that there's going to be a sudden bang or noise**.
8. At that time, I never **block my ears**. I just keep watching the screen and listening to the sound.
9. I guess although the sound is very very horrible and scary, if I already knew or believed that it's not in reality but in the virtual situation, I hardly be scared from the sound.
10. That's why I'm scared of my mother's saying, because it always related to the reality.

### 20170207 Do you play games?

#### Answer#1

1. I do. Do you know SIMS?
2. It's like playing with dolls for adults.
3. So you build and control a neighborhood of virtual people and they're called SIMS.
4. It's up to series 4 now.
5. But I was **completely** addicted to them.
6. So at one point, I said when I was studying to get into dent school, I said, you know, is it going to be dentistry or is it going to be SIMS?
7. About three weeks after I had bought the new CD, I had to snap it in half because I was just on it 24/7.
8. I have a very addictive personality.
9. **So I tried to stay away from them**.
10. Other ones are arcade games.
11. A pin ball, or mine sweeper, that's always a good one.
12. What about you?

#### JMC

1. I do. Do you know Clash Royale?
2. It's a real-time multiplayer game and one of the top 10 grossing mobile games in 2017.
3. Basically, you choose 8 cards (card means a character) out of all you have and you have to make a good combination to win a battle.
4. And I usually play that game one hour a day, especially when I'm on the subway to school or home.
5. It's a kind of my regular activity when I feel bored and when I don't want to think of anything.
6. But sometimes I do it habitually although I have something to do like homework or chores.
7. Then it's a **completely** waste of time and I makes me feel very bad.
8. 'Oh my god, how much time did I spend on this game? I'm screwed up.'
9. **So I try to stay away from it** when I feel I'm wasting my time.
10. What about you?
