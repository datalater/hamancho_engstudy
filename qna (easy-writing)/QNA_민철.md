### 20170215 Do you know someone who has OCD?

#### Answer#1

1. I **actually** know **several**.
2. Two of my patients, back in Austrailia, they had OCD.
3. Uh, both were female, um, and for both of them, their main, a sort of, ritual centered around cleaning.
4. So one, she washed her hands in very, very hot water.
5. **Until** she had blisters and they were raw and red.
6. And the other patient, she brushed her teeth with so much force.
7. That her teeth were all worn out. (The gums or the teeth?)
9. The teeth. Really hard bristles, and brushing, and I'm talking two hours, three hours a day.
10. The toothpaste, it's actually very abrasive, so if you brush for that long, that can happen.
11. **So those are** pretty extreme **cases of OCD**.

1. Well, I must confess this is not a first time I'm hearing this term OCD, but it's been a so long time ago.
2. So, I tried to think of any person who has it, but nothing comes to mind.
3. So, I reflected on myself and I **actually** found **several**.
4. First, I always wash my hands first when I get home from being anywhere.
5. Even if I've just been for a walk alone for a short time.
6. Why I always do that?
7. Well, you know, I'm not a person who is a germ freak, I mean, who is obssesive with cleanliness like 서장훈.
8. But, uhm, while washing my hands, I think I can feel my hands being cleaned and it makes me feel better.
9. Let's suppose I couldn't wash my hands because of some reasons, like someone else is already using the bathroom, or I got a phone call.
10. You know what? Within a few minutes, I can feel some desire is arising and it makes me wash my hands.
11. Second, I think this is a real OCD I have, it's unbearable to think I fail this.
12. When there is something I can be good at and I care about it, then I always try to get it **until** I convince myself that I did my best.
13. For example, let's say, I took the math exam and I studied with my best the other day.
14. But I got a low score. What do I do then? How do I feel about it?
15. I never feel sad or bad. Because I know I did my best, I just take it and stay calm.
16. But, let me say, I just jump to the conclusion that I can't make it without much effort.
17. And after the challenge, say, I come to realize that it's not that hard and it was doable for me.
18. Then I feel very, very bad and irritated and it makes me regret.
19. So I usaully try to make an effort not to regret and I don't regret very often.
20. **So those are my cases of OCD**.

### 20170213 What kind of sounds scares you?

#### Answer#1

1. **For me**, it's not the type of sound but it's when it's sudden.
2. **You know**, when I'm walking, in the pedestrian foot path, and the taxi, they honk.
3. For a brief second to make, in case you were looking for taxi.
4. **That always makes me jump**.
5. When they don't have any passenger, and they are passing by a passenger, they honk for **a very brief second**.
6. (To see if the passenger want to get on the cab?)
7. Yeah! To get their attention.
8. That always makes me jump and also **at the theater**, when I'm seeing a film.
9. And I **can anticipate that there's going to be a sudden bang or noise, I block my ears** in preparation.
10. **They don't even have to be loud, just sudden**.

#### JMC

1. **For me**, it's my mother's suddenly saying "큰일났네" when I didn't expect at all.
2. And **you know** it's like "어머나 큰일났네" when she realized something wrong.
3. **That always makes me jump**.
4. It's a very brief second, but it makes me think of tens of thousands of any possible things to go wrong.
5. And it makes my heart beating for a very short minute.
6. **They don't even have to be loud, just sudden**.
7. But you know, **at the theater**, when you're watching horror movies, sometimes **you can anticipate that there's going to be a sudden bang or noise**.
8. At that time, I never **block my ears**. I just keep watching the screen and listening to the sound.
9. I guess although the sound is very very horrible and scary, if I already knew or believed that it's not in reality but in the virtual situation, I hardly be scared from the sound.
10. That's why I'm scared of my mother's saying, because it always related to the reality.

### 20170207 Do you play games?

#### Answer#1

1. I do. Do you know SIMS?
2. It's like playing with dolls for adults.
3. So you build and control a neighborhood of virtual people and they're called SIMS.
4. It's up to series 4 now.
5. But I was **completely** addicted to them.
6. So at one point, I said when I was studying to get into dent school, I said, you know, is it going to be dentistry or is it going to be SIMS?
7. About three weeks after I had bought the new CD, I had to snap it in half because I was just on it 24/7.
8. I have a very addictive personality.
9. **So I tried to stay away from them**.
10. Other ones are arcade games.
11. A pin ball, or mine sweeper, that's always a good one.
12. What about you?

#### JMC

1. I do. Do you know Clash Royale?
2. It's a real-time multiplayer game and one of the top 10 grossing mobile games in 2017.
3. Basically, you choose 8 cards (card means a character) out of all you have and you have to make a good combination to win a battle.
4. And I usually play that game one hour a day, especially when I'm on the subway to school or home.
5. It's a kind of my regular activity when I feel bored and when I don't want to think of anything.
6. But sometimes I do it habitually although I have something to do like homework or chores.
7. Then it's a **completely** waste of time and I makes me feel very bad.
8. 'Oh my god, how much time did I spend on this game? I'm screwed up.'
9. **So I try to stay away from it** when I feel I'm wasting my time.
10. What about you?
