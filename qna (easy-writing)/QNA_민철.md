### 20170817 Do you have a special preference for ramyun?

1. I didn't have a special preference for ramyun until I become a college student.
2. While I was in freshman in college, I used to enjoy ramyuns in the cafeteria.
3. And one day, I ordered my ramyun and I was running to get it and, next to my ramyun tray, I found a bowl of red pepper powder.
4. It was kind of confusing and I thought, 'Oh is it for ramyun? Do people here put the powder on ramyun?'
5. I wasn't sure but I thought it would be kind of helpul to make my ramyun delicious, you know, because red pepper makes a ramyun more spicy and spicy ramyun is tasty.
6. So I put it on and, what a surprise, it was fantastic. I really enjoyed the ramyun with red pepper powder.
7. And from that day, whenever I found a red pepper powder, I put it on my ramyun.
8. But you should know it only happens at the restaruant, I do not this at home, because red pepper is expensive.

4. 약간 헷갈렸고, 생각했다, '라면에 넣으라고 있는건가? 여기서는 그렇게도 먹나?'
5. 확실하진 않았지만, 생각했다, 도움이 될거라고, 내 라면이 맛있어지는데, 알다시피, 고춧가루는 라면을 더 맵게 하고, 매운 라면을 맛있으니까.
6. 그래서 고춧가루를 넣었는데, 와 놀랍게도, 매우 맛있었다. 고춧가루 넣은 그 라면을 정말 맛있게 먹었다.
7. 그래서 그날 이후로, 고춧가루를 발견하면, 라면에 넣는다.

**Answer#1**:

1. I do.
2. Uh, sometimes when I come across particular saying or quote that really speaks to me, I write it out in my diary.

### 20170220 Until when do you want to work?

#### Answer#1

1. **Well, my current plan, as I have told you before, is to** stay in Korea until I'm around 40, at which point I will return to Austrailia and continue working as a dentist **until I physically can**.
2. So **my wish is to**, even if it's only for a day or two or a week, I would like to continue working for **as long as I can**.
3. (Do you have a ballpark as to round what age that will be for a dentist?)
4. Hmm, For a dentist, so, most of the times, a lot of my senior, they stop working because of back problems.
5. Yeah. Because the posture is really bad.
6. If you're really careful, 75. So I'm looking at that.
7. It happens if you look after yourself well.
8. And some of my friends, their aims is I'm gonna **save enough money** by 35 and retire when I'm 35, but me? No.
9. I want to work for as long as I can.

#### JMC

1. **Well, my current plan, as I have told you before, is to** **save enough money** and retire early and go and live in Jeju island or something and teach students there **until I physically can**.
2. That's the plan I made when I was around 22.
5. So if your question is to ask about when I want to retire, then my answer is the sooner is the better.
3. But I should make it clear that my retiring from work doesn't mean that I'll never work anymore.
4. It just means to be financially independent.
5. And I believe I can achieve it after I become a professional in a particular area.
6. So after I retire from making a living, then I will share my experiences or knowledge to younger generation.
7. And I think that's the second work that's waiting for me.
8. To summarize, **my wish is to** retire form making a money as soon as I can, but I want to work **as long as I can** if I can contribute to make a better world.

### 20170218 Do you have a phobia for something?

#### Answer#1

1. I don't think so.
2. I mean I have a dislike for something, but I won't call them phobias.
3. What about you?

#### JMC

1. I actually have acrophobia.
2. But it doesn't mean that I'm always scared of heights.
3. When I ride something at the amusement park, I'm not terrified at all.
4. It just makes me excited.
5. The situation I feel acrophobia is when there's no safety equipment so that I can easily imagine the scene of an accident with a high possibility.
6. But you know what? When I was younger than now, like 16 or 17, until then, I've never felt a fear of heights.
7. I even have a experience that I sit on the top of the school building with my friends, when I was 6th grade in the elementary school.
8. It was like the height of about 7 to 8 story aprtment buildling, so if someone had pushed me at least 5cm away, I would have been dead.
9. But at that time, I enjoyed the feeling of a thrill and I used to push myself to the extreme so I never felt any phobia.
10. And I still naturally hate to be afraid of something, so when I find something scary or hard to control, then I try to get over it by any means if it feels like a obstacle in my life.
11. But, considering that I have acrophobia and it's not that easy to get over now, I think I'm getting older and weaker.
12. I miss my youth and my bravery so much.

### 20170215 Do you know someone who has OCD?

#### Answer#1

1. I **actually** know **several**.
2. Two of my patients, back in Austrailia, they had OCD.
3. Uh, both were female, um, and for both of them, their main, a sort of, ritual centered around cleaning.
4. So one, she washed her hands in very, very hot water.
5. **Until** she had blisters and they were raw and red.
6. And the other patient, she brushed her teeth with so much force.
7. That her teeth were all worn out. (The gums or the teeth?)
9. The teeth. Really hard bristles, and brushing, and I'm talking two hours, three hours a day.
10. The toothpaste, it's actually very abrasive, so if you brush for that long, that can happen.
11. **So those are** pretty extreme **cases of OCD**.

#### JMC

1. Well, I must confess this is not a first time I'm hearing this term OCD, but it's been a so long time ago.
2. So, I tried to think of any person who has it, but nothing comes to mind.
3. So, I reflected on myself and I **actually** found **several**.
4. First, I always wash my hands first when I get home from being anywhere.
5. Even if I've just been for a walk alone for a short time.
6. Why I always do that?
7. Well, you know, I'm not a person who is a germ freak, I mean, who is obssesive with cleanliness like 서장훈.
8. But, uhm, while washing my hands, I think I can feel my hands being cleaned and it makes me feel better.
9. Let's suppose I couldn't wash my hands because of some reasons, like someone else is already using the bathroom, or I got a phone call.
10. You know what? Within a few minutes, I can feel some desire is arising and it makes me wash my hands.
11. Second, I think this is a real OCD I have, it's unbearable to think I fail this.
12. When there is something I can be good at and I care about it, then I always try to get it **until** I convince myself that I did my best.
13. For example, let's say, I took the math exam and I studied with my best the other day.
14. But I got a low score. What do I do then? How do I feel about it?
15. I never feel sad or bad. Because I know I did my best, I just take it and stay calm.
16. But, let me say, I just jump to the conclusion that I can't make it without much effort.
17. And after the challenge, say, I come to realize that it's not that hard and it was doable for me.
18. Then I feel very, very bad and irritated and it makes me regret.
19. So I usaully try to make an effort not to regret and I don't regret very often.
20. **So those are my cases of OCD**.

**끝.**

### 20170213 What kind of sounds scares you?

#### Answer#1

1. **For me**, it's not the type of sound but it's when it's sudden.
2. **You know**, when I'm walking, in the pedestrian foot path, and the taxi, they honk.
3. For a brief second to make, in case you were looking for taxi.
4. **That always makes me jump**.
5. When they don't have any passenger, and they are passing by a passenger, they honk for **a very brief second**.
6. (To see if the passenger want to get on the cab?)
7. Yeah! To get their attention.
8. That always makes me jump and also **at the theater**, when I'm seeing a film.
9. And I **can anticipate that there's going to be a sudden bang or noise, I block my ears** in preparation.
10. **They don't even have to be loud, just sudden**.

#### JMC

1. **For me**, it's my mother's suddenly saying "큰일났네" when I didn't expect at all.
2. And **you know** it's like "어머나 큰일났네" when she realized something wrong.
3. **That always makes me jump**.
4. It's a very brief second, but it makes me think of tens of thousands of any possible things to go wrong.
5. And it makes my heart beating for a very short minute.
6. **They don't even have to be loud, just sudden**.
7. But you know, **at the theater**, when you're watching horror movies, sometimes **you can anticipate that there's going to be a sudden bang or noise**.
8. At that time, I never **block my ears**. I just keep watching the screen and listening to the sound.
9. I guess although the sound is very very horrible and scary, if I already knew or believed that it's not in reality but in the virtual situation, I hardly be scared from the sound.
10. That's why I'm scared of my mother's saying, because it always related to the reality.

### 20170207 Do you play games?

#### Answer#1

1. I do. Do you know SIMS?
2. It's like playing with dolls for adults.
3. So you build and control a neighborhood of virtual people and they're called SIMS.
4. It's up to series 4 now.
5. But I was **completely** addicted to them.
6. So at one point, I said when I was studying to get into dent school, I said, you know, is it going to be dentistry or is it going to be SIMS?
7. About three weeks after I had bought the new CD, I had to snap it in half because I was just on it 24/7.
8. I have a very addictive personality.
9. **So I tried to stay away from them**.
10. Other ones are arcade games.
11. A pin ball, or mine sweeper, that's always a good one.
12. What about you?

#### JMC

1. I do. Do you know Clash Royale?
2. It's a real-time multiplayer game and one of the top 10 grossing mobile games in 2017.
3. Basically, you choose 8 cards (card means a character) out of all you have and you have to make a good combination to win a battle.
4. And I usually play that game one hour a day, especially when I'm on the subway to school or home.
5. It's a kind of my regular activity when I feel bored and when I don't want to think of anything.
6. But sometimes I do it habitually although I have something to do like homework or chores.
7. Then it's a **completely** waste of time and I makes me feel very bad.
8. 'Oh my god, how much time did I spend on this game? I'm screwed up.'
9. **So I try to stay away from it** when I feel I'm wasting my time.
10. What about you?
