### 20170207 Do you play games?

#### Answer#1

1. I do. Do you know SIMS?
2. It's like playing with dolls for adults.
3. So you build and control a neighborhood of virtual people and they're called SIMS.
4. It's up to series 4 now.
5. But I was **completely** addicted to them.
6. So at one point, I said when I was studying to get into dent school, I said, you know, is it going to be dentistry or is it going to be SIMS?
7. About three weeks after I had bought the new CD, I had to snap it in half because I was just on it 24/7.
8. I have a very addictive personality.
9. **So I tried to stay away from them**.
10. Other ones are arcade games.
11. A pin ball, or mine sweeper, that's always a good one.
12. What about you?

1. I do. Do you know Clash Royale?
2. It's a real-time multiplayer game and one of the top 10 grossing mobile games in 2017.
3. Basically, you choose 8 cards (card means a character) out of all you have and you have to make a good combination to win a battle.
4. And I usually play that game one hour a day, especially when I'm on the subway to school or home.
5. It's a kind of my regular activity when I feel bored and when I don't want to think of anything.
6. But sometimes I do it habitually although I have something to do like homework or chores.
7. Then it's a **completely** waste of time and I makes me feel very bad.
8. 'Oh my god, how much time did I spend on this game? I'm screwed up.'
9. **So I try to stay away from it** when I feel I'm wasting my time.
10. What about you?
