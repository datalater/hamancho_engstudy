1. I do. Do you know Clash Royale?
2. It's a real-time multiplayer game and one of the top 10 grossing mobile games in 2017.
3. Basically, you choose 8 cards (card means a character) out of all you have and you have to make a good combination to win a battle.
4. And I usually play that game one hour a day, especially when I'm on the subway to school or home.
5. It's a kind of my regular activity when I feel bored and when I don't want to think of anything.
6. But sometimes I do it habitually although I have something to do like homework or chores.
7. Then it's a **completely** waste of time and I makes me feel very bad.
8. 'Oh my god, how much time did I spend on this game? I'm screwed up.'
9. **So I try to stay away from it** when I feel I'm wasting my time.
10. What about you?
