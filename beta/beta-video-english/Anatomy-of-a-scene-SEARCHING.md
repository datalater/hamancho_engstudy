## Refine Script and Read It Aloud 

1. "Hi. My name is Aneesh Chaganty. I’m the co-writer and director of Searching."
2. "Hey, Margo. Dad again."
3. "So the scene that you’re watching right now takes place early in the film.
4. The film is about a dad whose daughter goes missing, and he tries to look for clues to find her.
5. The entire film takes place on the tech devices that we use everyday to communicate.
6. That’s laptops, cell phones, desktop computers.
7. Basically every single tool that we use every day is a tool that we use to tell the story.
8. In this moment right now he is realizing that his daughter might actually be in piano classes that she goes to every Friday.
9. So he’s going to try and find out how to reach her there.
10. The trick to kind of tackling this movie was basically by not making it boring.
11. That was a huge thing that we talked about all the time.
12. Like how do we elevate this concept?
13. How do we make it feel like a capital M movie and not just a gimmick of a film that was lasting for 90 minutes?
14. So from day one, in order to solve that we basically realized that what we should be doing is by using every single cinematic trick that we feel like we’ve learned, and that has been developed over the last 100 years, whether that’s a camera push in, or a dolly, or a lens flare, or just a narrative trick.
15. If it was figured out before us, let’s apply it to this screen.
16. And we figured if we take these small, mundane devices that we use everyday to communicate, and apply all these cinematic tricks to it, we will be making something, hopefully, that feels like something that you’ve never seen before.
17. So this particular moment David is finding out that his daughter not only has not been going to piano classes the last few weeks, but actually canceled her classes months ago.
18. And it’s the beginning of him realizing that his daughter is actually not at all the person that he thought she was.
19. So he’s looking at these messages right now.
20. We’re kind of panning back and forth.
21. We’re punching in.
22. And we’re kind of mixing live action footage and animated footage in a way that feels hopefully seamless for an audience, to hopefully give them a very, very cinematic experience on a platform that I don’t think any of us, including us, the writers and the filmmakers, originally thought was possible.
23. But it’s why we’ve made this movie, because when pull it off, we thought, hey, wouldn’t it be a really, really cool experience for an audience if we did?"
