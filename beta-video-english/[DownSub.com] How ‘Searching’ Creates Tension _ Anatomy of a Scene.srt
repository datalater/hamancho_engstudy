1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:00,720
“Hi.

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,843
My name is Aneesh Chaganty.

3
00:00:01,843 --> 00:00:04,912
I’m the co-writer and
director of ‘Searching.'"

4
00:00:04,912 --> 00:00:05,660
“Hey, Margo.

5
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:06,327
Dad again."

6
00:00:06,327 --> 00:00:08,160
“So the scene that
you’re watching right now

7
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,640
takes place early in the film.

8
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,660
The film is about a dad
whose daughter goes missing,

9
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,240
and he tries to look
for clues to find her.

10
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,790
The entire film takes
place on the tech devices

11
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,710
that we use everyday
to communicate.

12
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,940
That’s laptops, cell
phones, desktop computers.

13
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,820
Basically every single
tool that we use every day

14
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,070
is a tool that we use
to tell the story.

15
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,744
In this moment right
now he is realizing

16
00:00:30,744 --> 00:00:32,910
that his daughter might
actually be in piano classes

17
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,750
that she goes to every Friday.

18
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,980
So he’s going to try and find
out how to reach her there.

19
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,170
The trick to kind of
tackling this movie

20
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,027
was basically by not
making it boring.

21
00:00:43,027 --> 00:00:45,360
That was a huge thing that
we talked about all the time.

22
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,960
Like how do we
elevate this concept?

23
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,220
How do we make it feel like a
capital M movie and not just

24
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,990
a gimmick of a film that
was lasting for 90 minutes?

25
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,170
So from day one, in order
to solve that we basically

26
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,300
realized that what
we should be doing

27
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,880
is by using every single
cinematic trick that we feel

28
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,010
like we’ve learned, and
that has been developed

29
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,660
over the last 100
years, whether that’s

30
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,380
a camera push in, or a
dolly, or a lens flare,

31
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,110
or just a narrative trick.

32
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,030
If it was figured
out before us,

33
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,650
let’s apply it to this screen.

34
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,650
And we figured if we take
these small, mundane devices

35
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,680
that we use everyday to
communicate, and apply all

36
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,270
these cinematic
tricks to it, we

37
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,830
will be making
something, hopefully,

38
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,810
that feels like something
that you’ve never seen before.

39
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,210
So this particular
moment David

40
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,740
is finding out that his
daughter not only has not

41
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,750
been going to piano
classes the last few weeks,

42
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,020
but actually canceled
her classes months ago.

43
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,880
And it’s the beginning
of him realizing

44
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,820
that his daughter is actually
not at all the person

45
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,830
that he thought she was.

46
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,870
So he’s looking at these
messages right now.

47
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,160
We’re kind of panning
back and forth.

48
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,190
We’re punching in.

49
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,520
And we’re kind of mixing live
action footage and animated

50
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,470
footage in a way that
feels hopefully seamless

51
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,900
for an audience, to hopefully
give them a very, very

52
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,440
cinematic experience on a
platform that I don’t think

53
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,840
any of us, including us, the
writers and the filmmakers,

54
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,471
originally thought
was possible.

55
00:02:05,471 --> 00:02:07,470
But it’s why we’ve made
this movie, because when

56
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,430
we realized we could
pull it off, we thought,

57
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,596
hey, wouldn’t it be a really,
really cool experience

58
00:02:11,596 --> 00:00:00,000
for an audience if we did?"
