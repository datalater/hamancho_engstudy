### skating

A: Hey, listen, are you closed to the general public, or you just closed to everybody.. you know what I mean?  
B: Hey look. It's after 6 o'clock, it's Thanksgiving. That's why there's nobody here. And besides you ain't supposed to be in here. So do me a favor and not stay here, huh?  
A: Would you do me a favor?  
B: Hey, come on. We're not operating.  
A: Look, this girl ain't feeling well, you know, The doctors say she should go out and exercise once in a while and ice skating's probably the best thing, you know what I mean?  
B: Yes. So what do you want from me?  
A: Well, I want you to do me a favor. You could see she ain't feelin' too good. If you could let her on the ice, I'd appreciate it. For a few minutes.  
B: Ten minutes, ten bucks.  
A: Ten bucks? How 'bout eight.. eight bucks?  
B: Come on. It's Thanksgiving.  
A: All right, nine bucks, you got a deal.  
B: You have the ice to yourself. Ten bucks.  
A: Give her the blades.
