* **Josh** I don't know if I've told you much about the Korean education system before.
* **Chris** Never.
* **Josh** They all go to a normal school until 3 or 4 and then from 4 or 6 they go into an afterschool academy.
* **Josh** Everyday. it's building up to this one test.

---

* **Josh** Didn't you go to Cambridge University, Jenny?
* **Jenny** Yes.
* **Josh** You went to Cambridge and you're finding this difficult?
* **Jenny** Yes.

---

* **Chris** I just wanna encourage people because I can feel the pain of exam stress. So keep going!
* **Chirs** One of the things that I really wanted to do was to visit some students, Those who were doing their Suneung (university entrance exam). To be able to go in, see them, hear their side of the story. Spend a little bit of time with them. Hopefully if we can, in some small way, offer them some encouragement.

* **Josh** This is the room we're going into.
* **Jenny** Wow, that looks difficult.
* **Josh** Is this for Suneung study?
* **Jsoh** Do you guys wanna introduce yourselves?
* **Chris** I'm Chris.
* **Jenny** Wait! Do it in Korean.
* **Chris** I can do that now.
* **Jenny** Now you can have a go.
* **Chris** When is Suneung?
* **Students** November 15th.
* **Chris** How do you feel?
* **Students** Very tense.
* **Chris** And after Suneung, you go to university?
* **Students** We each get our own grades. And then depending on like how much you got on a particular test, they divide you and they assort you to the universities you can go to.
* **Josh** Oh my gosh!
* **Students** We go to school until 8 o'clock in the morning and finish school at 10 o'clock at night.
* **Chris** No!
* **Jsoh** 10 pm?!
* **Jsoh** Then what? Go home and sleep?
* **Students** Some do homework, some go to sleep, some go to reading rooms.

---

* **Jenny** They were just really hard-working.
* **Chris** You're quite disciplined though. I'm not disciplined.
* **Chris** I remember being at Cambridge and not wanting to sit in my room, but wanting to go a library and work there. Possibily, you...
* **Jenny** Distract me.
* **Chris** You might be there. Alriiight!
* **Chris** She still did well. She may have done better if she didn't know me, but then you know, she got to marry me.
* **Jenny** Oh well.. Maybe.

---

* **Josh** Now, jenny. You went to Cambridge. What was your life in high school like? Cos you studied a lot.
* **Jenny** Yeah, but not as hard as this. So school was like, 8:30 until 4?
* **Josh** 6 hours earlier than Korean schools.
* **Jenny** Yeah. And then you go home probably do like maximum three hours of studying. You don't have to do maths, unless it's a maths subject. So my degree was Religious Studies.
* **Jsoh** So for your last two years of high school, the only things you stduied were English, Chemistry, and Drama?
* **Jenny** Yeah.
* **Jsoh** It's quite different, right?
* **Jenny** Yeah.

~2:40

* **Jsoh** For someone getting into Seoul National University, what do you need to do to get in?
* **Students** Maximum two or ... Yeah. you can get two questions wrong out of the whole test.
* **Jsoh** Maximum two?
* **Jenny** Oh my gosh!
* **Josh** How many quetions are there total?
* **Students** There are 45 Korean questions, 45 English questions, 30 Maths questions. There are a bloody lot of quetions.
* **Josh** So it feels like a lot of pressure coming up.
* **Students** It is a lot of pressure.

---

* **Josh** This looks like something out of a film. Do you guys understand this?
* **Chris** Let's get some chalk.
* **Josh** What's going on?!
* **Chris** Three equals one. Trinity!

---

* **Josh** Alright guys. We're gonna let you keep studying for a bit. Thank you so much for taking time to talk to us. 
* **Chris** Back to the study. Keep it up!

---

* **Jenny** I feel like I may be expected it to be a bit more serious. You know? Like these kids to be super stressed out. And they were just really nice. They're in it together, supporting each other, and just like. Quite inspiring.

---

* **Chris** This is sweet.
* **Jenyy** They're really nice! This is something you'd never see, would you? If you were just on holiday.
* **Chris** There's that mixed feeling of both being like, hey wow! you guys keep going! And also, you want to just give them a hug and go, it's okay. This doesn't determine your whole likfe about everything of who you are. If I was in this country in this culture, I would just not have done well.
* **Josh** Do you think so?
* **Chris** Educationally, no. Cos the way I learn is not classroom based. Cos I wanna move and ...
* **Josh** You wanna experience things? 
* **Chris** Yeah, I'm more fidgety, and I have twin brother so we were distracting each other. So I never did well in classroom settings. These guys are super smart. Obviously super smart. Super capable.
* **Josh** Some of them never even lived outside Korea, And they speak English better than my Korean!
* **Chris** Fluent!
* **Jenny** It's amazing.
* **Chris** Ah, your heart goes to them. I want to encourage them. Want to bless them somehow. I don't really know how to do that.
* **Josh** Do you wanna order them some food?
* **Jenny** Yeah! That'd be nice!

---

* **Josh** Alright guys! Let's eat!
* **Students** Oh my goodness!
* **Jenny** Let's do this!
* **Josh** Let's begin.
* **Chris** Tastes good. It is hot!
* **Josh** Is it spicy?
* **Jenny** Will you guys be studying together untill November?
* **Students** Yes.
* **Jenny** So you can support each other.
* **Studnets** We do. I think that's the best part about high school in Korea because, since everyone has to go through the same process, you all feel this relationship and just bond together with your friends.
* **Chris** Oh, that's good.
* **Jenny** I feel like Koreans must come out at the end of education just so capable. Good job! The world is your oyster!
* **Students** Actually this dream is to become a movie director.
* **Jenny** Cool!
* **Students** I want to have a job related to baseball. I really like baseball.
* **Chris** Honestly, when we got out there, I was thinking about like, does this study sometimes squash creativity because you're learning by regime and rote, but ...
* **Josh** Those both sound like creative roles.
* **Chris** Yeah! That's really exciting! That's really cool! What about you guys?
* **Students** I kind of like talking or making speeches in front of the pbulic. And sometimes...
* **Jenny** You shold be a priest!
* **Josh** Yeah. Chris does a lot of speeches.
* **Students** I also have my thoughts about how society like runs. So I wanted to be like a social activist later on.
* **Chris** I mean, if I can encourage you, keep leaning forward in life. People that change the world are the ones who don't necessarily just accept the environment but lean through it, push through it. That's really exciting, but it's tough, right? It's tough to do. And anything worth doing sometimes is, it's tough. Keep leaning into life not allowing life to lean you over.
* **Sutdents** That's really important.
* **Josh** There you go. Some of the life wisdom from a priest. That one's for free.
* **Students** I think most of the Korean high school students don't know what exactly they want to do. I think the reason why we study so hard these days, is to have more decisions later on when I have to decide or I find what to do.

---

* **Chris** It was really special to spend an extended period of time with a group of young people. To be able to chat with them, hear from them about life. We had preconceived notions of what they would be like. And also the intensity of their workload. They weren't just kind of zombies in some sort of work regime that would destroy their souls. But they acutally were together, they worked hard. And they saw the reason for them working hard. And that was really nice to actually hear their side of the story. That was really, I find it quite special.

---

* **Josh** I think, from our perspective, it can be so like, oh my gosh! You guys are studying so hard. Like, you're so devoted to this one thing. It's really interesting you said that the reason you guys are doing this. The reason you're working so hard now is so that you can have freedom of choice. To do what you want to do later. Because that makes so much sense. Whatever you say about the Korean system, whether you think it's like the best education system or not, the fact is, the system in Korea is like this right now. And so to see you guys living in this country and taking it on and like doing your very best. It's a good thing! You guys are going for it! You're killing it!
* **Students** I think especially for students in Korea, some students really don't know what path they want to take. But then, they study just because they have to go to a good university, because society tells them to. And a lot of Korean students are aware of that. So maybe that can change one day.
* **Chris** I mean, studying is good, right? Studying is good. And it's good to study hard. IT's good to go to a good school. But you know, not at the expense of health and mental well-being. So it's about having some sort of healthy balance. I mean, obviously, Korea is famous for your hard work. It's amazing, so impressive. Quite intimidating as well.

* **Ollie** Just one last thing, Jen, how did you manage the workload at Cambridge?
* **Josh** Do you have any tips for studying and working through this craziness?
* **Jenny** I made sure I took time off. I tried not to study on a Sunday. Which is really hard. And sometimes that meant that I did kind of jobs like washing and stuff on Sunday but, I tried to give my brain a break. It was good for me to make myself a structure. So that when I was relaxing, I wasn't feeling guilty about it. I could just take time off and be like, this is actually good cos it will help me study better in the week.
* **Josh** Well, thank you so much for filming with us today.
* **Jenny** It's been so nice to meet you all.
* **Josh** It's been fascinating and really enlightening. And we will be cherring you guys all.
* **Chris** Keep it up!
* **Jenny** Good luck!
* **Josh** And to all of you taking your Suneung this year. And all of you guys out there feeling pressure from studying, keep in there!

* **Chris** It was actually one of the sweetest episodes we did. If you're watching this, bless you!

* **Josh** I guess that's all for today!
