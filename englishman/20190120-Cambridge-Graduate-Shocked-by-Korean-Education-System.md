* **Josh** I don't know if I've told you much about the Korean education system before.
* **Chris** Never.
* **Josh** They all go to a normal school until 3 or 4 and then from 4 or 6 they go into an afterschool academy.
* **Josh** Everyday. it's building up to this one test.

* **Josh** Didn't you go to Cambridge University, Jenny?
* **Jenny** Yes.
* **Josh** You went to Cambridge and you're finding this difficult?
* **Jenny** Yes.

* **Chris** I just wanna encourage people because I can feel the pain of exam stress. So keep going!
* **Chirs** One of the things that I really wanted to do was to visit some students, Those who were doing their Suneung (university entrance exam). To be able to go in, see them, hear their side of the story. Spend a little bit of time with them. Hopefully if we can, in some small way, offer them some encouragement.

* **Josh** This is the room we're going into.
* **Jenny** Wow, that looks difficult.
* **Josh** Is this for Suneung study?
* **Jsoh** Do you guys wanna introduce yourselves?
* **Chris** I'm Chris.
* **Jenny** Wait! Do it in Korean.
* **Chris** I can do that now.
* **Jenny** Now you can have a go.
* **Chris** When is Suneung?
* **Students** November 15th.
* **Chris** How do you feel?
* **Students** Very tense.
* **Chris** And after Suneung, you go to university?
* **Students** We each get our own grades. And then depending on like how much you got on a particular test, they divide you and they assort you to the universities you can go to.
* **Josh** Oh my gosh!
* **Students** We go to school until 8 o'clock in the morning and finish school at 10 o'clock at night.
* **Chris** No!
* **Jsoh** 10 pm?!
* **Jsoh** Then what? Go home and sleep?
* **Students** Some do homework, some go to sleep, some go to reading rooms.

* **Jenny** They were just really hard-working.
* **Chris** You're quite disciplined though. I'm not disciplined.
* **Chris** I remember being at Cambridge and not wanting to sit in my room, but wanting to go a library and work there. Possibily, you...
* **Jenny** Distract me.
* **Chris** You might be there. Alriiight!
* **Chris** She still did well. She may have done better if she didn't know me, but then you know, she got to marry me.
* **Jenny** Oh well.. Maybe.

* **Josh** Now, jenny. You went to Cambridge. What was your life in high school like? Cos you studied a lot.
* **Jenny** Yeah, but not as hard as this. So school was like, 830 until 4?
* **Josh** 6 hours earlier than Korean schools.
* **Jenny** Yeah. And then you go home probably do like maximum three hours of studying. You don't have to do maths, unless it's a maths subject. So my degree was Religious Studies.
* **Jsoh** So for your last two years of high school, the only things you stduied were English, Chemistry, and Drama?
* **Jenny** Yeah.
* **Jsoh** It's quite different, right?
* **Jenny** Yeah.
